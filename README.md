# Django-Live-Chat-App

A chat application which was made using Django, Channels and Websockets.

This app supports user sign-up/registration and login authentication. 

Once users have registered an account and logged in, users can choose to join a specific chat room 
where they will be able to communicate in real time with other users who are also in the same chat room.

Messages are stored in a database so they will not be lost upon the web server restarting or the client refreshing their browser.
